## I forgot my password. How can I reset it?

An activation key will be sent to you to the mobile number associated with your username.


## I typed my password wrong several times, now it seems I can not log in. Has my account been closed?

Your account is most likely not closed. To prevent brute-force attacks, our
firewall has temporarily blocked your computer's IP address. Please try again
in 15 minutes.
If you still can not connect, please contact 
[Support](mailto: support@metacenter.no).

## I would like to change my shell. What do I do?

```bash``` is the only supported shell by the Metacenter. You may however change to another shell of your preference as long as you deal on your own with problems which might arise as a result of it.
For temporary use, you can simply call the new shell from bash. For persistent change, please contact support.

## My problem is not listed here. What do I do?

Send an email to the [Support](mailto: support@metacenter.no) team describing 
your problem. It will be beneficial to provide the job number which failed, 
paths to the jobs script, output file, error file and Makefile. 
One of the engineers will help you as soon as possible.
