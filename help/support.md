# Support line

All support requests concerning the e-infrastructure resources should go to
<support@uninett.no>.

Behind this address is an issue tracker (ticket system) and you will get an
automatic reply first and can expect response from our staff within hours
during normal work-hours, or at the latest the following working day (except
holidays).

When replying to email from the support line please keep the ticket number in
the subject line.

However, for a new problem, do not reply to emails with unrelated subjects (and
ticket numbers) as this can be confusing for us.

Please also look at the page for [how to write good support
requests](how_to_write_good_support_requests.md) on how to report problems in
the most effective way for getting help quickly.
