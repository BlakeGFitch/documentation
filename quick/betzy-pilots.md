# Getting started Betzy

This page is a quick intro for the projects invited to participate in the pilot
phase and relevant information will be eventually merged into main
documentation.

## Getting access

### Access during pilot

To be added.

### Support

Please use the regular [support channel](../help/support.md) to submit requests 
and mark the case with *Betzy*.

## Queue System

Betzy uses the SLURM queuing system. 
During the pilot phase there will be no limitations imposed. For generic information about job submission, please check out our documentation [here](../jobs/queue_system.md).

## Storage

Betzy uses a DDN powered 2.5 PB Lustre parallel file system with 51 GB/s bandwidth and 500k+  metadata operations per second.
The Lustre file system is mounted under `/cluster`.

Please note that *NO BACKUP* is taken during the pilot phase.
The `/cluster` file system might be reformatted at the end of the pilot phase, before machine being placed into production.

NIRD project file systems - `/trd-project[1-4]` - will be mounted on the Betzy
login nodes, similarly to Fram and Saga HPC clusters.
