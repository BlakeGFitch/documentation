Betzy
The supercomputer is named after [Mary Ann Elizabeth (Betzy) Stephansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Stephansen), the first Norwegian woman with a Ph.D in mathematics.

The most powerful supercomputer in Norway
Betzy is a BullSequana XH2000, provided by [Atos](https://atos.net/en/solutions/high-performance-computing-hpc), and will  give Norwegian researchers more than 5 times more capacity than previously, with a theoretical peak performance of 6.2  PetaFlops. The supercomputer, which will be placed at [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.no/) in Trondheim, will be available to users during the second half of 2020.

 

## Technical specifications:
The system comprises of 1344 compute nodes each equipped with 2 x 64core, next-generation AMD EPYC™ processors, code name ‘Rome’, for a total of 172032 cores installed on a total footprint of only 14.78m2. The total compute power will be close to 6Pflops.
The system will consume 952kW of power and 95% of the heat will be captured to water.
The computes nodes will be interconnected with the new generation of Mellanox HDR technology.
The data management solution will rely on a DDN storage with a Lustre parallel file system of more than 2.5PB.
