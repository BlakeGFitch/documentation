# Betzy

Named after [Mary Ann Elizabeth (Betzy) Stephansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Stephansen), the first Norwegian women to be awarded a doctorate degree.

## The most powerful supercomputer in Norway

Betzy is a BullSequana XH2000, provided by Atos, and will  give Norwegian researchers more than 5 times more capacity than previously, with a theoretical peak performance of 6.2  PetaFlops. The supercomputer, which will be placed at NTNU in Trondheim, will be available to users during the second half of 2020.
