## Notes to self.

### Missing stuff

- OpenMP example(s)
- MPI + OpenMP example(s)
- qsumm - must be rewritten first

### Needs more work

- Work directory.  Should we have a separate page inside "JOBS", or
  modify https://documentation.sigma2.no/storage/storagesystems.html ?
  (Perhaps modify, if possible.)
- A few details and FIXMEs here and there; smaller decisions, etc.

### Questions

- For how much mem/cpu should we recommend using bigmem?  Suggestion:
  Fram: > 4 GiB/cpu, Saga: > 8 GiB/cpu
- Perhaps use **bold** instead of *italics* for terms?
