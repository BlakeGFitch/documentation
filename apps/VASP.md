# VASP (Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package)

VASP is a complex package for performing ab-initio quantum-mechanical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using pseudopotentials or the projector-augmented wave method and a plane wave basis set. The approach implemented in VASP is based on the (finite-temperature) local-density approximation with the free energy as variational quantity and an exact evaluation of the instantaneous electronic ground state at each MD time step.

## License and access policy

VASP is a commercial software package that requires a license for all who wants to use it. To get access to the VASP install:

Your group must have a valid licence. To acquire a licence, please consult this link: [how-can-i-purchase-a-vasp-license] (https://www.vasp.at/index.php/faqs/71-how-can-i-purchase-a-vasp-license).

We need to get a confirmation from a VASP representative to confirm that you have access to the license. Your group representative needs to contact the VASP team and ask them to send a confirmation email to support@metacenter.no to confirm that you have a valid licence. 

Once we receive the confirmation email we will add the user in question to the VASP group. Note that we do not anymore support release 4 of the VASP code.

    
## Usage 

You load the application by typing:

	$ module load VASP/<version>

For more information on available versions, type:

	$ module avail VASP
