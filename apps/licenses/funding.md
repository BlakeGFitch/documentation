# Changes in funding policy

Currently the cost for a number of licenses for application software is carried
by the Metacenter. This will change in 2020 and after 2020 the Metacenter will
not fund licenses for application software (e.g. ADF, BAND, Crystal, Gaussian,
GaussView, Molpro).

For these codes and the corresponding research groups and research communities
the Metacenter will offer consulting for pooling costs and for the maintenance
of common license certificates and servers. The Metacenter will help these
communities to set up coordination points to simplify paperwork and save costs.

Note that the Metacenter will continue to fund licenses for development tools
(compilers, debuggers, profiling tools) - these base tools are not affected by
the planned change in funding policy.
