# General comments about licenses and access policies

This is an attempt to describe the different licenses we have in the Metacenter
for scientific software.

I will only address licenses with a certain access limitation. For free, open
source codes without any limitations, I refrain from commenting, apart from the
fact that the reader should be aware that “free” not allways means
“unrestricted access”.

Also, due to a choice of policy, this document is only about academic access to
licenses. For commercial licenses, the user or user groups needs to investigate
consequences and prices themselves. For any given code, the license model and
related issues is more in depth described as a part of the standard
documentation.

**There is in general  4 different levels of of access limitations for software
in the Metacenter:**

* License access limited on group level.
* License access limited on institutional level, either for all users from an institution (site) or for a limited subgroup of users from this institution (faculty/department/research-center/research-project).
* License access limited on Computer Center level; will typically mean that all users of all machines this computer center administer will have access.
	* A subset of this type is License access limited on machine level; will typically mean that all users on the machine in question have access.
* License access limited on more elevated agreement level; we do currently have a couple of software packages where there is a multilateral agreement between the participants in the BOTT (Bergen-Oslo-Trondheim-Tromsø) collaboration and some software vendors. All users from all these four institutions will have access. We also have a couple of national agreements, which implies that all national users or all users with a certain access domestically will be allowed access.

And, of course, you have the pool of software with access limitation of more
technical character - but as stated above, I will refrain from commenting...

**Users are responsible for having the correct credentials and agreements in
terms of license access in general**; for all software with access limitations
on group- and research-project level may have to be provided to the Metacenter
before being granted access to software installed on Metacenter controlled
machines.
