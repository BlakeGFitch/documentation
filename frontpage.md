# The Norwegian Academic HPC Services


## Introduction

The current Norwegian academic HPC infrastructure is maintained by an
organization called the [Metacenter](https://sigma2.no/metacenter), which is a
joint collaboration between the four oldest Universities in Norway
([UiO](https://uio.no), [UiB](https://uib.no), [NTNU](https://ntnu.no) and
[UiT](https://uit.no)) and [Sigma2](https://www.sigma2.no/).


### Acknowledging use of national HPC infrastructure

Projects are required to acknowledge the use of the national e-infrastructure
resources in their scientific publications. Papers, presentations and other
publications that feature work that relied on Sigma2 should include such an
acknowledgement.

UNINETT Sigma2 has defined the following template for such acknowledgements:

```
The computations/simulations/[SIMILAR] were performed on resources provided by
UNINETT Sigma2 - the National Infrastructure for High Performance Computing and
Data Storage in Norway
```
