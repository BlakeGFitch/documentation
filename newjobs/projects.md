Fra Abel:

Finding your projects

Projects may change names over time, they may expire and you may get access to new projects. To see which projects you currently have access to, you can use the command projects:

$ projects
nn2977k   
staff

Note that the queue system calls projects accounts. We will try to use the term project in this documentation.
Project quota for Notur projects

Notur projects (projects with name nnXXXXk or xaXXXXk) have a CPU (core) hour quota. The cost command is used to inspect the quota. Use

cost -u

to see how much you have used of the quota on your projects.  Use

cost

to see the available, used and total quota of your projects.  See cost --help for details.

Historic usage on Abel can be found here.
