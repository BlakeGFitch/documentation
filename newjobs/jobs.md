## Notes to self.

### Missing stuff

- OpenMP example(s)
- MPI + OpenMP example(s)
- how to run mpi jobs on Saga

### Needs more work

- Job scripts for each cluster.  Some of the info here should perhaps
  go into the corresponding job types page.
- Work directory.  Should we have a separate page inside "JOBS", or
  modify https://documentation.sigma2.no/storage/storagesystems.html ?
  (Perhaps modify, if possible.)
- Lots of details and FIXMEs here and there; smaller decisions, etc.
