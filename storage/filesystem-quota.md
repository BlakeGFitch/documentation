# Filesystem-quota

Quota is enforced on all our system, Users has their quota for $HOME and quota for different project areas that they have access to. We have two types of quotas, Disk quota and Inode quota.

Disk quota: Difines how much space you can use.

Inode quota: Difines how many files you can have 



## Default quotas for HPC resources and NIRD 
We will apply default quota for all users on fram,Saga and NIRD unless there are special need for diffent quota.
