# NIRD - National e-Infrastructure for Research Data

The new data infrastructure, named **NIRD** (National Infrastructure for Research Data),
will provide storage resources with yearly capacity upgrades, data security
through geo-replication (data stored on two physical locations) and adaptable
application services, multiple storage protocol support, migration to third-party
cloud providers and much more. Alongside the national high-performance computing
resources, NIRD forms the backbone of the national e-infrastructure for research
and education in Norway, connecting data and computing resources for efficient
provisioning of services.

The NIRD storage system consists of SFA14K controllers, 10TB NL-SAS drives with
a total capacity of 12PiB in addition to a centralized file system
(IBM GridScaler) supporting multiple file, block and object protocols. Sigma2
will provide the storage infrastructure with resources for the next 4 â€“ 5 years
through multiple upgrades and is expected to triple in capacity during its life-time.

The NIRD infrastructure offers Storage services, Archiving services and  processing capacity for computing on the stored data.
