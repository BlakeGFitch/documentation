# NIRD - National e-Infrastructure for Research Data

The new data infrastructure, named **NIRD** (National Infrastructure for Research Data),
will provide storage resources with yearly capacity upgrades, data security
through geo-replication (data stored on two physical locations) and adaptable
application services, multiple storage protocol support, migration to third-party
cloud providers and much more. Alongside the national high-performance computing
resources, NIRD forms the backbone of the national e-infrastructure for research
and education in Norway, connecting data and computing resources for efficient
provisioning of services.

The NIRD storage system consists of SFA14K controllers, 10TB NL-SAS drives with
a total capacity of 12PiB in addition to a centralized file system
(IBM GridScaler) supporting multiple file, block and object protocols. Sigma2
will provide the storage infrastructure with resources for the next 4 â€“ 5 years
through multiple upgrades and is expected to triple in capacity during its life-time.

There are two main uses for NIRD and visit the following pages for more information.
1. [Research Data](https://www.sigma2.no/content/data-storage)
2. [Storage of scientific project data](https://www.sigma2.no/content/storage-scientific-project-data)

Fram has a NIRD directory `/nird` that projects can use. For more information, visit the [Storage Systems on Fram](storagesystems.md) page.
