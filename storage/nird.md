# NIRD - National Infrastructure for Research Data

**NIRD** is the **N**ational e-**I**nfrastructure for **R**esearch **D**ata. It is
owned and operated by [UNINETT Sigma2](https://www.sigma2.no).

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <p>
    The NIRD infrastructure offers storage services, archiving services, and
    processing capacity for computing on the stored data.  It offers services and
    capacities to any scientific discipline that requires access to advanced, large
    scale, or high-end resources for storing, processing, publishing research data
    or searching digital databases and collections.
  </p>
</div>

NIRD will provide storage resources with yearly capacity upgrades,
data security through geo-replication (data stored on two physical
locations) and adaptable application services, multiple storage
protocol support, migration to third-party cloud providers and much
more. Alongside the national high-performance computing resources,
NIRD forms the backbone of the national e-infrastructure for research
and education in Norway, connecting data and computing resources for
efficient provisioning of services.


## Technical specifications

The NIRD storage system consists of SFA14K controllers, 10 TB NL-SAS
drives with a total capacity of 12 PiB in addition to a centralized
file system (IBM GridScaler) supporting multiple file, block and
object protocols. Sigma2 will provide the storage infrastructure with
resources for the next 4 â€“ 5 years through multiple upgrades and is
expected to triple in capacity during its life-time.


## Getting access

To gain access to the storage services, a formal application is required. The process
is explained at the [How to apply for a user account](https://www.sigma2.no/how-apply-user-account) page.


## Logging in

Access to the project data storage area is through front-end (login) node:
```
login.nird.sigma2.no
```

Note that this host name is actually a DNS alias for
`login0.nird.sigma2.no`, `login1.nird.sigma2.no`,
`login2.nird.sigma2.no` and `login3.nird.sigma2.no`.  Those are
containers, each one running the image of a login node. A login
container offers resources for a maximum of 16 cpus and 128 GB of
memory.

Users must be registered and authorized by the project responsible
before getting access.

To access or transfer data use the following tools: `ssh`, `scp` or
`sftp`.  Visit the [Transferring files](../faq/file_transfer.md) page
for details.


## Home directories

Each user has a home directory `/nird/home/<username>`, where
`<username>` is the username.  The default quota for home directories
is 20 GiB and 100 000 files.  To check the disk usage and quotas, type:
```
$ dusage
```

Home directories on NIRD also contain a backup of Fram and Saga home
directories (when relevant) in `/nird/home/<username>/backup/fram` and
`/nird/home/<username>/backup/saga`.
To account for this default quota is doubled when relevant.
Note that this is a _backup_ from the HPC cluster; you cannot transfer
files to the cluster by putting them here.


## Project area

Each project gets a NIRD project area `/nird/projects/NSxxxxK`,
where `NSxxxxK` is the ID of the project.

The project area has a quota on disk space and the number of files,
and you can see the quota and the current usage by running:
```
$ dusage -p NSxxxxK
```

The NIRD project area is also mounted on the login nodes (but _not_
the compute nodes) of Fram or Saga, when relevant. For more
information, visit the [Fram and Saga](clusters.md) page.
