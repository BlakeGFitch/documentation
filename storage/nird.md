# NIRD - National e-Infrastructure for Research Data

The new data infrastructure, named **NIRD** (National Infrastructure for Research Data),
will provide storage resources with yearly capacity upgrades, data security
through geo-replication (data stored on two physical locations) and adaptable
application services, multiple storage protocol support, migration to third-party
cloud providers and much more. Alongside the national high-performance computing
resources, NIRD forms the backbone of the national e-infrastructure for research
and education in Norway, connecting data and computing resources for efficient
provisioning of services.

The national e-infrastructure is adopting a data-centric architecture and the
new storage system from SGI/DDN marks the beginning of a new era. The demands
for performance are significantly increased for NIRD, compared to its predecessor
Norstore, due to the fact the new HPC systems and future on-demand services such
as data analytics and visualization now will be directly connected to the
storage infrastructure.

There are two main uses for NIRD and visit the following pages for more information.
1. [Research Data](https://www.sigma2.no/content/data-storage)
2. [Storage of scientific project data](https://www.sigma2.no/content/storage-scientific-project-data)

Fram has a NIRD directory `/nird` directory that projects can use. For more information, visit the [Storage Systems on Fram](storagesystems.md) page.
